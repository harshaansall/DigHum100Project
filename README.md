# DigHum100Project

## Description
#### Some people view football as a pointless and barbaric game. This notion could not be further from the truth! Football is a very sophisticated game in which very intelligent players engage! Football is a billion dollar industry that allocates a lot of resources towards the game. One of the most interesting developments in the National Football League over the years is the rise of the use of analytics! Analytics now play a very important role in the NFL as a means to improve the league as a whole, but also to give teams a competitive advantage! I am very passionate about Football as it has been a very important part of my life. In this project, I hope to display my passion for football through the use of another developing passion in Data Science!

## Tools
#### The tools to be used for this project are Python and a Jupyter notebook. I will use the Jupyter notebook and python to analyze my dataset, create visualizations, and simulate models. 


## Repository
#### In this repository, I will keep my dataset, my notebook, and additional files.
