# DigHum100Project

## Description
#### A common thing noticed by NFL reporters is that players seem to be getting more athletic over time. This observation lends itself to statistical analysis. In this project, I will use a dataset from Kaggle on NFL combine data which contains values for different players. These values include different metrics to measure speed and strength which indicate athleticism. 

## Tools
#### The tools to be used for this project are Python and a Jupyter notebook. I will use the Jupyter notebook and python to analyze my dataset, create visualizations, and simulate models. 


## Repository
#### In this repository, I will keep my dataset, my notebook, and additional files.
